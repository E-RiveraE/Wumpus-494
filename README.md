**Instructor: Dr. Miller-Edwards**


This program simulates a simplified version of the Wumpus World game. It reads from an input file (wumpus.txt) that specifies the locations of 
pits, glowing paradise (gold), and the Wumpus using the following notation:

    P[x,y] - Pit at coordinate (x,y)
    G[x,y] - Glowing paradise (gold) at coordinate (x,y)
    W[x,y] - Wumpus at coordinate (x,y)
