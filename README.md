# Programming Project #1
**ACO/MAT 494 - FALL 2025**
**Instructor: Dr. Miller-Edwards**


This program simulates a simplified version of the Wumpus World game. It reads from an input file (wumpus.txt) that specifies the locations of 
pits, glowing paradise (gold), and the Wumpus using the following notation:

    P[x,y] - Pit at coordinate (x,y)
    G[x,y] - Glowing paradise (gold) at coordinate (x,y)
    W[x,y] - Wumpus at coordinate (x,y)
Please make sure you have an IDE in which you can run the Java files. Make sure the cords.txt file is located outside the source code folder or it may not run properly.
